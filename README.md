```bash
# port 5000 default
flask run
```

#### Rules
1. Keep the logic of your application separate from the layout/presentation of web pages.
- Use templates to achieve this separation between presentation and business logic.
- Rationale: hire a web designer to create a killer web site while you code the application logic in Python.
